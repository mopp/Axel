//! The name conversions are defined because Intel's names are confusable I think.
//! Name conversions:
//!     Frame              := Physical memory block
//!     Page               := Virtual memory block
//!     Level4 Table/Entry := PML4E, Page Map Level 4 Table/Entry
//!     Level3 Table/Entry := PDPTE, Page Directory Pointer Table/Entry
//!     Level2 Table/Entry := PDE, Page Directory Table/Entry
//!     Level1 Table/Entry := PTE, Page Table/Entry
//!
//! In x86_64 system, the virtual address is composed of four parts (in 4KB mapping):
//! Note that the virtual address is called linear address in the intel manual.
//!      9bit(Index of level 4)
//!      9bit(Index of level 3)
//!      9bit(Index of level 2)
//!      9bit(Index of level 1)
//!     12bit(Physical address offset)
//!     9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 12 = 48
//!      ------------------------------------------------
//!      | Level4 | Level3 | Level2 | Level1 |  Offset  |
//!      ------------------------------------------------
//!     47      39 38    30 29    22 20    12 11        0
//!
//! Each index is represented by 9bit.
//! This means the number of the entries in each table is 512 (2^9) respectively.
//! Then, the size of an entry is 8bytes.
//! So, The size of a table is (8 * 512 = 4096 = 4KB) and it corresponds the minimum page size.
//!
//! For more information, please refer 4.5 IA-32E PAGING in the intel manual.
